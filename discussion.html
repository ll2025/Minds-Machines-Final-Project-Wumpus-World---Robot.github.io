    <h2>Performance and Suggestions on the Robot:</h2>
    <h4>(** IN PROGRESS **)</h4>
    <h2>Relating this Project to Class:</h2>
    <h3>Does the robot have a mind and is it intelligent or conscious?</h3>
    <h4>3C or The Wumpus Destroyer is capable of navigating the board to get the gold whilst avoiding danger. 
      It does this by tile by tile movement and analyzing of the signals it recieves in order to determine the safe route. 
      This may seem like signs of intelligence or even consciousness but there are several factors that say otherwise in this case. 
      The Wumpus Destroyer as of now is only programmed to this specific game - the Wumpus World. 
      All the decisions made to get to the goal are all based off the rules we set in place.
      So, if one were to try and place our Wumpus Destroyer in another game, say Chess, this would not go well let alone go anywhere. 
      Another factor to consider is the ability to learn, either from ones mistakes or success.
      When a human plays Chess, they learn new strategies as they play more often and learn what not to do that resulted in unfavorable consequences previously (losing pieces and/or the game).
      Though for the Wumpus Destroyer, nothing is taken away after each play of the game or considered as to why certain paths were good or bad outside of its base programming telling it yes or no.
      Therefore, we have concluded that the robot does not have a mind and is not intelligent or conscious as it cannot learn or make its own decisions outside of its original programming. (** IN PROGRESS **)</h4>
    <h3>Do you feel any differently regarding the feasibility of AI after this project?</h3>
    <h4>We feel that while currently there are many softwares, websites, and platforms based off of or using AI, there is still much work until AI can be considered to have a mind, conscious, and intelligence. (** IN PROGRESS **).</h4>
